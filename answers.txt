Part 1 
    Question (d):
    Answer:
        1. The Flesch-Kincaid score doesn’t always reflect real reading difficulty, especially for poetry or literary novels. 
        These types of texts often use unusual sentence structures, creative punctuation, or figurative language that the 
        formula isn’t designed to handle. This can lead to misleading scores, making the text seem much easier or harder 
        than it actually is if the writing style doesn’t follow standard rules.
        2. Another limitation is that the Flesch-Kincaid score doesn’t consider whether the vocabulary is common or rare. 
        Even if a text is full of technical or specialized words that most people don’t know, it might still get a 
        low (easy) score if the words themselves are short. The formula doesn’t check if the vocabulary is familiar 
        or used in everyday language, so it can underestimate the difficulty of texts in fields like science or law.
